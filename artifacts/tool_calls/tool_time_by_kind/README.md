# tool_time_by_kind

**Across all tool calls, which tool kinds account for the most *total* effective time —
separately for Claude Code and Codex?**

## Experiment overview

Every agent step in the trace carries a `tools[]` list of tool calls, each with a measured latency.
This experiment attributes that latency to tool kinds and asks where the aggregate tool-execution
time goes, rendering one horizontal-bar panel per provider with tools ordered by summed latency
(each bar annotated with its call count `n`).

Method and assumptions:

- **Effective tool latency** = `tool_internal_latency_ms` if present, else `tool_wall_latency_ms`
  (the shared `trace_db.EFFECTIVE_TOOL_LATENCY_MS_SQL` precedence; the legacy `latency_ms` field is
  not in the normalized data). Only **strictly positive** latencies contribute to a tool's
  summed/averaged time; calls with no effective latency are counted as `missing_latency_calls`.
- **Additive over calls.** Latency is summed per tool kind. Parallel tool calls are *not* merged
  into elapsed wall-clock time, so this measures attributed work, not end-to-end session time.
- **One row per call.** We aggregate entries in `tool_calls` (the UNNESTed `tools[]`), not agent steps.
- **MCP tools are merged (figure only).** Any tool whose name starts with `mcp_` is aliased to a
  single `mcp` bucket; the long server-qualified names are individually rare. The CSV keeps the raw
  unaliased names.
- **Rare tools collapse (figure only).** Tools with fewer than `--min-tool-calls-for-plot`
  provider-local calls (default 20) are summed into one `Other (<N calls/tool)` bar. The CSV keeps
  full per-tool detail — nothing is dropped from the data, only from the plot.
- **Exact, not sampled.** Sums, counts and averages are computed over *all* tool calls in SQL (the
  old per-tool reservoir sampler is gone), so the totals are exact.

## Code structure

`plot.py` is a thin query→shape→plot pipeline over the shared trace DuckDB:

- `_tool_time_query(plot_name_expr, *, by_provider)` — the shared aggregation: normalizes the tool
  name (blank/NULL → `<unknown-tool>`), applies the effective-latency precedence, and emits
  per-bucket `calls`, `latency_count`, `missing_latency`, `error_calls`, `latency_sum`, plus a
  first-appearance `first_seen` ordinal for a deterministic tie-break. `plot_name_expr` selects the
  raw name (CSV) or the `mcp_*`→`mcp` alias (figure); `by_provider` adds the `rounds.provider` join.
- `load_tool_time(con)` — global `{tool_name: ToolTimeStats}` for the CSV (raw names, no collapsing).
- `load_tool_time_by_provider(con, *, min_calls)` — per-provider stats with the MCP merge done in
  SQL and the rare-tool collapse in Python (summing is order-independent).
- `plot_tool_total_time_by_kind(...)` — the per-provider summed-latency panels.
- `write_tool_total_time_by_kind(...)` — the full-detail CSV.
- `main()` — wires the standard `trace_db` CLI (`--db` | `-i/--input` | `-o/--output-dir`) to the
  above and embeds the self-contained PNG sidecar.

`ToolTimeStats` ties are broken by `first_seen` (min global call ordinal) so output is stable across
DB builds — `GROUP BY` order is not. The data layer (parsing, surrogate keys, schema) lives in
`artifacts/utils/trace_db.py`; see `artifacts/utils/DB_SCHEMA.md`.

## Running it

```bash
# default merged trace, output next to this README
uv run python artifacts/tool_calls/tool_time_by_kind/plot.py

# a specific trace (materialized to a temp DuckDB cache on first use)
uv run python artifacts/tool_calls/tool_time_by_kind/plot.py -i trace/sample.jsonl

# a prebuilt DB (run_all.py's build-db step passes this), into a chosen dir
uv run python artifacts/tool_calls/tool_time_by_kind/plot.py --db /tmp/trace.duckdb -o /tmp/out
```

Useful flags: `--top-tools` (max bars per panel, default 30), `--min-tool-calls-for-plot`
(rare-tool collapse threshold, default 20).

## Outputs

Written to `-o` (default this folder):

- `tool_total_time_by_kind.png` — provider-paneled total effective time per tool kind.
- `tool_total_time_by_kind.csv` — full per-tool totals: `tool_calls`, `valid_latency_calls`,
  `missing_latency_calls`, `error_calls`, `total_latency_ms`/`_s`/`_hours`, `latency_share`,
  `avg_latency_ms`.

The PNG is self-contained — it embeds this README, the CSV, and the plotting code. Unpack with
`python artifacts/utils/png_sidecar.py extract <png>`.

## SyFI result analysis

### tool_total_time_by_kind.png

Aggregate tool-execution time is dominated by a handful of tool kinds rather than spread across the
vocabulary. The ranking is by **summed** latency (with `n=` call counts annotated), which separates
two routes to the top: being called constantly versus being individually slow. Claude's `Bash`
leads everything at ~771h over 67k calls (~46% of all tool time) — high volume *and* a long tail —
followed by Codex's `write_stdin` at ~317h. The third bar exposes the other regime: Claude's
`AskUserQuestion` reaches ~243h on only 784 calls, because each one blocks waiting on the human
(avg ~19 min/call); `Agent` (~55h) and `ExitPlanMode` (~51h) are similar slow-but-rare blockers. By
contrast Codex's `exec_command`, the single most-called tool at 187k calls, totals only ~51h
because each call is cheap. Because latency is additive over parallel calls these are attributed
work, not wall-clock session time; the CSV (`latency_share`, `avg_latency_ms`) has the exact
figures, including the tail collapsed into `Other`.
