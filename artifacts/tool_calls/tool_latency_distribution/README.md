# tool_latency_distribution

**How long do tool calls take, per tool and per provider, and where does the long tail of tool
latency live — for Claude Code vs Codex?**

## Experiment overview

Every agent step carries a `tools[]` list of tool calls, each with a measured latency. This experiment
profiles that per-call latency four ways: a per-tool/per-provider box-and-whisker view, a
count-vs-latency mass breakdown over coarse latency bins, and two cumulative CDFs (by call count and
by summed latency) over the per-call latency threshold.

Method and assumptions:

- **Effective tool latency** = `tool_internal_latency_ms` if present, else `tool_wall_latency_ms`
  (= `result_at − emitted_at`; the shared `trace_db.EFFECTIVE_TOOL_LATENCY_MS_SQL` precedence — the
  legacy `latency_ms` field is not in the normalized data). Internal timing is the runner-reported
  duration (Codex wrapper `Wall time`, Claude `durationMs`).
- **Only strictly-positive latencies feed the distribution.** A call with no effective latency is
  counted as `missing_latency`; a call with a non-positive effective latency is `nonpositive_latency`
  — neither enters the boxplots, bins, percentiles, or CDFs (matching the old `ToolStats`).
- **MCP tools are merged (figure only).** Any tool whose name starts with `mcp_` is aliased to a
  single `mcp` bucket; the long server-qualified names are individually rare. CSV summaries keep the
  raw, unaliased names.
- **Rare tools collapse (figure only).** Tools with fewer than `--min-tool-calls-for-plot`
  provider-local calls (default 20) fold into one `Other (<N calls/tool)` box. CSV summaries keep
  full per-tool detail.
- **CDFs are additive over calls.** Latency totals sum per call — parallel tools are *not* collapsed
  into wall-clock time, so the total-latency CDF measures attributed work, not elapsed session time.
- **Exact, not sampled.** Box quartiles, whiskers, percentiles and CDFs are computed over *every*
  positive effective latency pulled from SQL. The old per-tool 50k reservoir sampler is gone, so the
  summary CSV reports `sampled=False` and `sample_count` = the full `latency_count` for every tool
  (previously the two highest-volume tools, `exec_command` and `Bash`, were reservoir-sampled).

## Code structure

`plot.py` is a thin query→shape→plot pipeline over the shared trace DuckDB:

- `_per_tool_query(plot_name_expr, *, by_provider)` — the shared per-tool aggregation: normalizes the
  tool name (blank/NULL → `<unknown-tool>`), applies the effective-latency precedence, and emits per
  bucket the call/`latency_count`/`missing_latency`/`nonpositive_latency`/`error_calls` counts,
  `latency_sum`/`min`/`max`, the exact `list(eff)` of positive latencies, and a first-appearance
  `first_seen` ordinal. `plot_name_expr` selects the raw name (CSV) or the `mcp_*`→`mcp` alias
  (figure); `by_provider` splits per `rounds.provider`.
- `load_tool_stats(con)` — global `{tool_name: ToolStats}` for the summary CSV (raw names, no
  collapsing), inserted in first-appearance order so the stable `sort(key=calls)` reproduces the old
  dict-order tie-break.
- `load_tool_stats_by_provider(con, *, min_calls)` — per-provider stats for the boxplot with the MCP
  merge in SQL, then the rare-tool collapse in Python; real tools are inserted in **alphabetical**
  plot-name order (the old merged-dict order) with `Other` appended last, pinning equal-call ties.
- `load_tool_latency_values_by_provider(con)` — `{provider: [positive latency, …]}` feeding both
  CDFs (exact, no reservoir).
- `load_tool_latency_bins(con, *, by_provider)` — the 8 coarse `TOOL_LATENCY_BINS_MS` half-open bins
  (call/error counts + summed latency), global and per-provider.
- `plot_*` / `write_*` — the four figures and four CSVs.
- `main()` — wires the standard `trace_db` CLI (`--db` | `-i/--input` | `-o/--output-dir`) and embeds
  the self-contained PNG sidecar.

The matplotlib 3.9 `labels`→`tick_labels` boxplot-kwarg rename is handled by the `_BOXPLOT_LABEL_KW`
shim so the figure also renders under the matplotlib 3.8.x bundled with Pyodide (the web Analyze
tab). The data layer (parsing, surrogate keys, schema) lives in `artifacts/utils/trace_db.py`; see
`artifacts/utils/DB_SCHEMA.md`.

## Running it

```bash
# default merged trace, output next to this README
uv run python artifacts/tool_calls/tool_latency_distribution/plot.py

# a specific trace (materialized to a temp DuckDB cache on first use)
uv run python artifacts/tool_calls/tool_latency_distribution/plot.py -i trace/sample.jsonl

# a prebuilt DB (run_all.py's build-db step passes this), into a chosen dir
uv run python artifacts/tool_calls/tool_latency_distribution/plot.py --db /tmp/trace.duckdb -o /tmp/out
```

Useful flags: `--top-tools` (max boxes per panel, default 30), `--min-tool-calls-for-plot`
(rare-tool collapse threshold, default 20).

## SyFI result analysis

### tool_latency_by_tool.png

Latency depends heavily on tool type, and the per-call spread within a type is large (the paper's
`fig:tool_latency_by_tool_top12`). Average tool-call latency across the trace is ~16.8s, but that
mean hides enormous structure: fast file/edit primitives (`Read` p50 36 ms, `Edit` p50 95 ms,
`Grep`, `apply_patch`) cluster in the tens-to-hundreds of milliseconds with tight boxes, while
blocking tools — `Agent`, `AskUserQuestion`, shell execution, `wait_agent`/`request_user_input` —
sit seconds-to-minutes to the right with much wider boxes. Even inside one tool the range is huge:
Claude's `Bash` runs from milliseconds to minutes yet keeps a sub-second median (p50 ~409 ms).
Boxes are the IQR with the median line and 5th/95th whiskers (outliers suppressed); tools are
picked per provider by call count then ordered by median, so vertical position reads as typical
slowness. The takeaway: tool type guides latency but is not sufficient on its own to predict it.

### tool_latency_weighted_bins.png

The headline asymmetry (the paper's `fig:tool_latency_weighted_bins`): most calls are fast, but
most *time* is spent in the rare slow calls. Each provider gets two 100%-stacked bars over the
coarse latency bins — tool-call share on top, summed-latency share below — with dashed arrows tying
each bin's slice between the two. The split is dramatic and provider-specific: for Claude, sub-1s
calls are ~70% of calls but under 1% of total tool time, while calls over 1 min are only ~4.9% of
calls yet contribute ~92% of the time. Codex is less extreme but still tail-dominated — sub-10s
calls are ~88% of calls but ~12% of time, while calls over 1 min are ~3.1% of calls and ~61% of
time. This is the classic heavy-tail signature: optimizing the median tool call barely moves total
tool time; the long-running outliers own the budget.

### tool_latency_count_cdf_by_provider.png

Cumulative tool-call count at or below a per-call latency threshold, per provider. The inset table
carries exact p25/p50/p90/p99/avg.

- Codex's curve rises later but steepens sharply around the ~1s mark (a near-vertical step where a
  large block of `write_stdin`/`exec_command` calls land at similar latencies), then saturates;
  Claude rises earlier and more smoothly (median ~129 ms vs Codex ~626 ms).
- Both curves flatten well before the minutes range — the overwhelming majority of calls resolve in
  under a few seconds, confirming the long tail is a small fraction of *calls*.

### tool_total_latency_cdf_by_provider.png

The same threshold sweep weighted by summed latency (in hours), i.e. where the aggregate tool time
accumulates. The dashed `5m` reference marks how many hours come from calls faster than five
minutes.

- Both curves stay near zero until the seconds-to-minutes range, then climb steeply — the bulk of
  the hundreds of cumulative hours is contributed by calls in (and beyond) the minutes range, even
  though those calls are rare (per the count CDF).
- Claude accumulates more total tool-hours overall (~1251h vs Codex's ~413h) and keeps climbing
  into the multi-hour tail; Codex's total plateaus earlier. Because latency is additive over
  parallel calls, treat these totals as attributed tool work, not elapsed wall-clock session time.
